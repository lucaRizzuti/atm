For the purpose of this exercise I decided to use AngularJs and Google material design.
I decided not to start from the classic angular-seed (recommended) but to write all from scratch,
so to keep the code short and not to have a huge amount of directories and files written not by me.
I wrote all in just one file, again not a good practice, but I thought it was easier to examine.

Started writing an array of objects containing the basis informations regarding virtual pages.
Tha app is a Single Page, the view is just in one file and DOM elements are showned or hidden.
